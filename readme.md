Restaurant Booking Website
This project contains code for a basic website homepage that allows users to log in and book tables at a restaurant.

Getting Started
To view the site locally, open the index.html file in a web browser.

The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Styles are defined internally for simplicity but an external CSS file could also be used.

Site Overview
The homepage contains:

Header with logo and navigation links
Hero section welcoming users
Login/signup form for existing users
Footer with copyright info
Future enhancements could include adding booking functionality, a menu page, and additional styling.

Contributing
